# Astar
This code is a simple implementation of A* on a coordinate grid space. The code generates a grid with random occupancy values, it finds the shortest path to a random target from a random start and will print this. This random generation does check to makes sure goal and target are not occupied however sometimes a path is not possible due to random generation and this will cause slight problems that are not taken care of already.
You will likely need to remove any ros msgs that are contained to run properly.
